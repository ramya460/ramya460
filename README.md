### Generative AI for Next-Generation Therapeutics  
Research-driven • Platform-first • Modality-focused

</div>

---

DrugParadigm is a generative AI–powered startup accelerating drug discovery through a unified, ready-to-use AI platform.  
Founded in **January 2025**, we bring together an interdisciplinary team of **30 researchers and engineers across 4 campuses** (KMIT, NGIT, KMEC, KMCE), focused on solving complex drug discovery challenges using deep learning and generative models.

---

### 🧬 What We Do

We build a **versatile AI ecosystem** designed to make advanced drug discovery more accessible and scalable through:

- ☁️ Cloud-based model access  
- 🔌 Direct API integration  
- 🖥 Dedicated GPU infrastructure  

Our systems are built to model **complex biological and chemical interactions**, enabling reliable predictive and generative performance across advanced therapeutic modalities.

---

### 🧬 Focus

Our research targets **next-generation drug modalities** that demand advanced AI beyond traditional small-molecule assumptions:

- Antibody–Drug Conjugates (ADCs)  
- PROTACs  
- Molecular Glues  
- Macrocycles  
- Peptide Therapeutics  
- Binding affinity prediction (protein–protein, peptide–MHC)

---

### 🛠 Currently Building

- Generative models for complex therapeutic design  
- A unified cloud + API platform for AI-driven drug discovery  
- Research-grade systems transitioning toward real-world deployment  

---

### ⚙️ Core Technologies

**Modeling:** Diffusion Models, Transformers, GNNs, SE(3)-equivariant models  
**ML Stack:** PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric  
**Infrastructure:** NVIDIA A100, multi-node GPU clusters  

---

### 🚀 Why It Matters

- Models outperform benchmarks published in **Nature, Oxford**, and leading academic labs  
- Designed for **real-world drug discovery**, not toy datasets  
- Bridging research-grade AI with deployable platforms  

All models are accessible via **https://drugparadigm.com**.  
Associated research papers are currently **under peer review**.

---

### 🤝 Collaboration

We are open to:
- Research collaborations  
- Co-development of custom AI models  
- Providing access to our AI frameworks and compute infrastructure
